Dear Hiring Manager,
                <br><br>


I'm interested in seeking a position at your company as a game developer. I would be delighted by the opportunity and canâ€™t wait to be a great asset to your company and to the team in general.
                <br>
        <br>

During my previous role at Entytec, I worked as Gameplay/Tools Programmer, where I got the opportunity to work on Characters, Enemy AI and UI development as the tools for the Unity3D editor. Also as part of my duties, I provided enhancements to the code in the game and was also able to provide solutions so the whole team could meet the deadline earlier than expected.
        
                <br>
        <br>

Thank you for your time and consideration reading this. I'm looking forward to learning more about your company. As a Game Developer, my goal is to continually increase my development skills in order to present better solutions to you as a potential employer. I enjoy uncovering new ideas and would use them to advance your company.
                <br>                <br>


Sincerely,
                <br>                <br>


Reynardo Perez
